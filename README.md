BukkitLib
=========

A commons libary for Bukkit.

This library was designed to aid in developing plugins by providing a variety of tools and implementations that Bukkit does not provide. If you have any suggestions, feel free to let me know and I'll work my way into setting it up. Optionally, you can fork this project and make pull requests to improve on this library.
